Did you have the one in NYC or HK? The Tim ho wans in HK with actual stars were legit when I had them. They've got one in Vegas that has been closed for a couple years, but just reopened. The only time I went, it was ==*wack*== (bad).
Hong Kong. Absolutely ==*feral*==.


Yeah agree with that. But ==putting on my snooty hat== - the people I know who have eaten a lot of fine dining around the world were very unimpressed with Gaa/Gaggan. People who watched Chef’s Table on Netflix and ate at Gaggan as their life’s first fine dining experience on a tourist visit through Bangkok were blown away. The latter just has no baseline comparison. ==Anecdotal== (fun), but pretty consistently anecdotal haha.

Okay, taking snooty hat off.

Great list but I have some non mentioned additions. I can ==vouch==(cross my heart (and hope to die)) for nusara and samrub being great, along with Potong which you didn’t mention.

More diminutive than definitive, but we hope we’ve covered just enough to ==whet==(sharpen) your appetite.
