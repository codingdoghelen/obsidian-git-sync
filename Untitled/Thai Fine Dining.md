>I've been to most of the starred restaurants, I think. My personal fave is ==Sühring==, but I haven't been since before COVID, so not sure how they're doing. Great service and atmosphere.
>
>==Le Normandie== is a classic. Should always be considered if looking for the "best" fine dining in BKK.
>
>For Thai food – ==Sra Bua== was a good recommendation. ==Le Du== is probably the top pick after Sorn (they placed 4th on Asia's 50 Best, just 2 places behind ==Sorn==). Good food - but not life-changing, IMO. And I still like ==Issaya Siamese Club==, even if it has gone a bit out of fashion and is a bit casual. ==80/20== lacks the atmosphere, but has top-tier food.
>Personally, I'm NOT a fan of ==Gaa== (I don't think the food is particularly good ... I thought the same about ==Gagan==). And ==Cagette== and ==Sri Trat== – which others have mentioned – aren't really fine-dining atmosphere or service quality. Though, both are charming enough in their ways.

>A few I haven't been to, but have a good buzz:
> ==Nusara== (by the Le Du team)
> ==Samrub for Thai== (Thai omakase)
> ==Blue by Alain Ducasse==

>You might want to try ==Signature== at VIE Hotel too. It's a bit under the radar at the moment (was about to open as Covid hit, didn't get a visit by Michelin yet) but it's a serious chef who had 2 stars back in France just before coming to BKK.
>
>edit: A good way to sample the food from many of these chefs is at the "Off Menu" Food Festival. It's supposed to come back around december-january.

---

>==Saawaan== - I found the food a lot like ==Le Du==, but a little less interesting. Not a particularly vibey atmosphere. I don't remember anything specific about the service, but I loosely remember I found Le Du more refined.
>
>Never been to ==R.Haan==. But I have been to nearby Canvas, where a Californian chef was doing interesting things with Thai ingredients. It was good... But I've never been back... Maybe take look. A bit casual in my memory (not a jacket and tie crowd).

>Probably an unpopular opinion: but I don't think Thai food (or Indian) fit "fine dining" as well as other cuisines. Forcing it into European-style coursing and using modish Western cooking techniques and traditional serving culture just doesn't work as well as it does with French or Austrian or Spanish food. Turning somtum into foam, then whispering over white table cloths, while sipping Barolo is trying to get a square peg into a round hole. Not to say that all these highly ranked restaurants aren't great. They are. But I think Thai food is more fun in less austere settings. (Like== ==Sri Trat==, ==Issaya==, etc)

>==Canvas== is doing 22 courses now and it’s a lot better than it used to be. Huge huge flavors and lots of risks. I love it and the menu is constantly evolving so we go every few months. Chef is Texan though not from California

---
>Great list but I have some non mentioned additions. I can vouch for ==nusara== and samrub ==being== great, along with ==Potong== which you didn’t mention.

---

> ==Sri Trat==???? LOL, expensive, pretentious presentation, but taste is nothing special really, and portions so small they put French cuisine to shame.

---
>Went to a restaurant called ==Nahm== (1 Michelin star) once. I liked the food and it was relatively cheap.

---
>I really like wanna yook a lot for modern Thai right now.
>
>My favorite spot in town is probably ==Potong== (Chinese/Thai) though, it’s a fun and interactive meal and the food was good. The bar (==Opium Bar BKK==) is also top class. 
>
>Both of those spots are new and both will get stars. Potong has a lot of PR and hype behind it so I expect it will make asias 50 best next year also.
>
---
> I like Sorn too. My biggest gripe is it’s a tasting menu and it’s the same every time we go with a couple of minor changes. I’ve been 6 or 7 times and it’s almost always the same meal. There will be an event in October only open to previous diners with a totally new menu for the month so that will be interesting.  
> 
> Good for a one time visit, but I don’t think worth all the hype but everyone who visits me always wants to go so we have been often.
> 
> We had the opposite experience at ==wanna yook==in regards to service. I guess it’s luck of the draw with your server which is unfortunate, I’ve only been there once but the service was immaculate and food very good but we were eating with a close personal friend of the owner (same guy that has 100 mahaseth) so that may have impacted our service. I’m pretty burned out on a lot of places as we eat out super often so we liked it as it was something new.
> 
> ==Small dinner club== is also interesting, some really really amazing courses, but also a couple that were legitimately bad.

---

>Been to ==Le Du== abd Khao, would say ==Khao== is better, but none really worthy of a Michelin star compared to what a Michelin star means abroad.

---

>As for the op. Try to book ==wanna yook==. It’s a new place and it’s amazing. Same style food as nusara (number 10 on asias 50 best restaraunts) and much much easier to get a table and we enjoyed wanna yook more than ==nusara==.
