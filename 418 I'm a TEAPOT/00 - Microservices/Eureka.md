Eureka is used in the communication of different [[00 Microservices]].

[[Service Discovery]] can be both [[Client-side]] and [[Server-side]].

[[Spring Cloud]] Eureka works on [[Client-side]], which means client will talk to [[Service Discovery]] (SD). Then SD will provide url and links to client. Then client can have the address to talk to [[00 Microservices]] directly.
